Built from scratch, I collaborated across multiple business domains and technical teams to eliminate compliance gaps and operational blind spots. This established a scalable foundation now serving as the firm-wide standard oversight solution. React, TypeScript, GraphQL - architected for massive scale.",
        "The One UI Platform for CRG consolidated three disparate applications - onboarding, restrictions, instructions, and radius maintenance - into a single integrated experience. This wasn't just code consolidation; it required deep domain modeling to unify different business workflows into coherent UX. Substantially reduced context switching and improved operational efficiency across the organization.",
